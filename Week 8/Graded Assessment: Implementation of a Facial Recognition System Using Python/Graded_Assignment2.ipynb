        "# Graded Assignment 2: Building a Face Verification and Recognition System with FaceNet\n",
        "\n",
        "In the digital era, face recognition systems are widely used in numerous applications including security systems, social sites among others. The capability of properly identifying and authenticating individuals is important for achieving safety and improving the experience of users. In this graded assignment, you will build a reliable face verification and recognition system using FaceNet, one of the most efficient deep learning networks available.\n",
        "\n",
        "FaceNet, developed by Google, is considered one of the best models for facial recognition. It does this by taking images of faces and transforming them into a compact and discriminative feature representation called embeddings. These embeddings are unique for each face, and thus it becomes easier to compare and identify faces from these embeddings. Through the FaceNet, you will be able to practice building a face verification system that is used in confirming a person's identity as well as the face recognition system that is used in identifying and labeling an individual from a given dataset.\n",

        "Main objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Understand how to preprocess face images properly to feed into the FaceNet model to increase the input quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Generate Face Embeddings: Employ the FaceNet model which is pre-trained on the given set of face images to obtain the corresponding embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Implementing Face Verification: Develop a face verification system that would be able to tell if the two given face images are of the same individual or not. This entails comparing the embeddings created by FaceNet and then setting a threshold for verification.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Building a Face Recognition System: Develop a face recognition system capable of recognizing a person from a given set of faces. This will entail matching embeddings of an unknown face to a database of known embeddings and identifying the most similar one.\n",

        "- Evaluation and Performance Analysis: Evaluate the findings to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the implementation.\n",

We begin by installing the keras-facenet package, followed by importing essential libraries for image processing and numerical operations, including numpy, and specific modules from Keras for handling images.\n",
        "\n",
        "The FaceNet model is initialized using facenet = FaceNet(), which loads the pre-trained model. The preprocess_image function is defined to prepare input images for the model: it loads an image from a given path, resizes it to 160x160 pixels, converts it to a NumPy array, adds an extra dimension to represent a batch of one image, and preprocesses the image to meet the input requirements of FaceNet. This preprocessing ensures that the image data is properly formatted for generating face embeddings or performing other face-related tasks with the FaceNet model."
